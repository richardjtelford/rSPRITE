This is a fork of Nick Brown's rSPRITE tweaked to run as an R package so I can easily run it locally.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rSPRITE from [GitHub](https://github.com/richardjtelford/rSPRITE/tree/package) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("richardjtelford/rSPRITE@package")
```

## Example

You can start the app with 

``` r
library(rSPRITE)
rSprite.app()
```
